          <p>Two of the biggest things that are happening technologically for humanity are in connecting all of the things we make to the world and understanding how we as humans connect with it. We are going from living in a world where our connections to it require human interaction to a world where our connections will connect themselves for us. Simply said, what matters now are device connections and neural connections.</p>

<p>These things are the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, respectively. Both domains aren&#8217;t new by any means. AI has the reputation of being ostracized in academia after decades of failures in neural networking and learning algorithms to achieve the dreams of the domain. However, now with many<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyzOUbkUf3M"> new theories and technologies</a>, as well as startup acquisitions, the dream of AI is very much alive in academia and the culture at large. Similarly, IoT has gone from being a science fiction plot to becoming a much more achievable reality. With DIY kits like Raspberry Pi, along with every iteration of Arduino and other microcontrollers, there&#8217;s a sense now that we can really start to connect the world in profound ways.</p>

<p>However, in spite of all of this success, both domains seem to be increasing horizontally as opposed to vertically. There&#8217;s a plethora of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_intelligence_projects">&#8220;AI&#8221; technologies</a>. Everything from the classic Deep Blue of the 90s, to the Google driverless car is considered AI. Certainly there is intelligence behind these innovations, and they are truly stunning, but we must ask: are these technologies just automating away a problem or are they getting us closer to truly understanding how understanding works? In other words, do these technologies learn in a way that is outside of their scope?</p>

<p>It seems that when we talk about AI  nowadays, we are really just talking about automation. Is it really intelligent if a program knows how to <a href="http://singularityhub.com/2011/09/19/ai-journalist-writes-sports-and-now-everything-else-statsheet-raises-4m-changes-name-and-focus/">be a sports writer?</a> What is such a machine or program doing beyond its own programmed abilities? Learning is the basis of intelligence, processing is secondary. Yet, it&#8217;s processing, based on very structured learning, that we seem to think of as the truly intelligent act.</p>

<p>Our intelligence is defined by our abilities to learn beyond the scope we are born with. Imagine when Neil Armstrong&#8217;s mother held him for the first time. Would it have even been in her imagination that Neil would ever step foot on another celestial body? When you look at a child, their innate scope of the world is incredibly small, but when you look at an a<em>rtificially intelligent</em> program the scope is immediately laid out for you. It&#8217;s not as if Neil Armstrong was born with a file that said he would become an astronaut. However, every a<em>rtificially intelligent</em> system I&#8217;ve seen has been explained to me in terms of precisely what it can ever accomplish. No human being is born with such a fate.</p>

<p>With respect to the AI world, the IoT market is similarly stratified horizontally. There are amazing sensors and actuators made by a wide array of <a href="http://postscapes.com/companies/">impressive companies</a> but it feels as if every IoT solution is just a <em>smart device </em>that accomplishes one task very well, just like AI. What would it mean then to have vertical AI, often referred to as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">strong AI</a>? It would simply be that we develop machines and programs that can learn, process, and act beyond their initial programming and can interact with the world in a novel way not imagined by its developers. In a way, it would do something that a human being could do that takes a significant amount of intelligence.</p>

<p>What then would vertical IoT, or strong IoT look like? It <strong>wouldn&#8217;t</strong> simply be when there are a lot of sensors and actuators on the primary objects we use. It would be when there&#8217;s actually &#8220;internet&#8221; to the Internet of Things. We will have come a long way when we stop having silos of networks and web apps for a particular brand&#8217;s line of IoT and when there&#8217;s an open interaction between all devices. Security considerations of course must be addressed but when we have open protocols and popular solutions for connecting and interacting with IoT devices, as if they were social networks, then we will be much further to <em>strong IoT</em>.</p>

<p>What happens then when we have achieved both strong AI and strong IoT? Well, some very exciting things will occur. We will truly have asymptotic changes in our society when artificially intelligent systems understand the physical world and direct it in productive ways that are beyond the power of an individual human being or groups of humans. When a system knows that something is going wrong in the environment based on some sensory data and its ability to learn, then we have transformative systems that go far beyond the reach of simple robotics. We will have intelligent systems that will know when a wild fire is happening and put it out, that will be able to organize your schedule after reading your emails, and that will be able to empower cities to be able to set up quick responses to emergency situations.</p>

<p>The IoT world and the AI world are converging. When we imagine ourselves in a world dominated by an Internet of Things, most of us actually imagine things that have a network with some intelligence. Mere sensors and actuators are great and mere automative AI programs are useful, but the two together are as transformative as the Industrial Revolution and the PC Revolution were. Who knows how far away this world will be but there will be plenty of room for new startups and even more room for imagination!</p>
