          <p>I was sitting down with a friend recently, talking over a late lunch one afternoon. He&#8217;s a hardware guy, I&#8217;m a software guy. He was telling me about a trend he noticed recently: people don&#8217;t want to pay for software. I thought that maybe he&#8217;s saying that out of ego, or maybe he&#8217;s just saying that because there&#8217;s a million apps on the market and there&#8217;s always value in rarity. He didn&#8217;t believe that though, so ellaborated. He said, &#8220;People can&#8217;t spend 99 cents on an app. They&#8217;ll do anything it takes to use software but not pay for it &#8212; stealing licenses, torrenting, you name it. But show them a cool device for a good price that solves their problems, they&#8217;ll pay good money for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I mulled that over and analyzed my own life. I&#8217;ve waited out almost indefitenly on signing up for premium services on software I use every day, just to stay in the semi-working freemium state I was used to for so long. Why is that? How come I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to pay for something that I use and would use even more every day?</p>

<p>It seems tangibility, like rarity, matters a lot to value. You&#8217;ll buy a crappy beer for 4 bucks at a bar, but if you bought a crappy app for the same price you could be enraged. So enraged maybe you might even leave a review on the app store or send an email to customer support. Would you do the same on the bar&#8217;s Yelp page?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something about the physical that is spellbinding in the most visceral way, almost more so than anything software can do. Yet we aren&#8217;t talking about beer, or food, or clothes though. We are talking about digital devices. A beautiful and amazingly functional piece of hardware is a tangible thing you can pick up and hold, but what is the value of it to your life? What is your interaction with it that serves a function for you?</p>

<p>The truth is, you find the value in the software. When you interact with a digital device it&#8217;s with an interface powered by software. When the digital device alerts you to something it&#8217;s the software that does it. When you control it to do a specific action for you, it&#8217;s through the software. This is not all to say the hardware or the engineers are unimportant, quite the contrary. It&#8217;s simply that software is what gives the hardware purpose.</p>

<p>This may all seem elementary and like a rehased argument from the days of yore, but it&#8217;s important to remember in the emerging world of the Internet of Things. There&#8217;s a lot of focus on how hardware startups are taking an ever-increasing amount of VC investments, and how it&#8217;s the hardware in the form of sensors and actuators that are defining the Internet of Things. That&#8217;s fundamentally wrong, it&#8217;s the software, and of course the hardware, that are shaping the industry. With more and more sensors in the world, there will need to be better and better software. Software that helps you make decisions from the hardware in your life, and let&#8217;s you control devices that have meaning to you. In other words, we need as good of software for IoT as hardware. It&#8217;s not all about simply seeing your coffee maker or fridge on the internet. It&#8217;s about the devices you have enhancing your life through the data and control they provide you, all via: software!</p>
