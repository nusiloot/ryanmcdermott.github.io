          <h4>What is IoT&#8217;s Current State?</h4>

<p>Whenever I hang out with relatives, or friends that are unfamiliar to the tech scene, I always bring up the emerging trend of Internet of Things. As I talk about common household and industrial devices equipped with sensors that communicate with each other and connect to the web, I notice their faces show a lot of intrigue. They tell me they see the value in a world with this kind of technology. When I ask them though if they own anything like what I am mentioning they say they don&#8217;t.</p>

<h4>So why is that?</h4>

<p>How come we are making so many advances in these technologies on a hardware level, yet we haven&#8217;t seen a large adoption of IoT? Perhaps maybe it&#8217;s because we haven&#8217;t made enough advances on the software side.</p>

<p>With Apple&#8217;s announcement of HomeKit this week that just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FggJeMwbLjg">might be changing</a>. HomeKit aims to fix the data silo issue, which is perhaps the biggest problem with IoT achieving more widespread adoption. Popular devices like Nest, Fitbit, SmartThings, and the many others all have their own apps and dashboards.What&#8217;s more, many establish their own protocol to communicate to other devices. With MQTT and Z-Wave gaining a lot in popularity some of these protocol issues are being solved organically, but yet there&#8217;s no cloud solution to connect these devices together. HomeKit just might be the best bet to solve this problem.</p>

<h4>Why Apple&#8217;s HomeKit over other solutions?</h4>

<p>Well doubtlessly there are many other great solutions such as up-and-coming startups like <a href="http://2lemetry.com/">2lemetry</a>. The difference though between these startups and Apple is that Apple has the cachet to not only excite many on-the-fence consumers about IoT, but they have the power to work with the many IoT device makers to agree on a standard interface and cloud solution for their products instead of simply consigning all functionality to their own home-brewed solutions.</p>

<h4>What is beyond HomeKit?</h4>

<p>Clearly, we don&#8217;t just need a central place to connect all of our devices in order for us to actuate them with Siri. That is a undoubtedly a nice thing, but our devices need to be truly smart. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better if your door lock, garage, and lights to learn when your sleep patterns were than for you having to command it through Siri? Moreover, wouldn&#8217;t it also be nice if they synced with your Google Calendar and learned when you were on vacation? Or even more intelligently, what if your moisture sensor in your attic went off and knew to schedule a repairman to come by for you? There are limitless possibilities when AI is applied to this. The first step though is having a cloud solution to work with all of the connected devices that we have or will end up having. If that solution is not HomeKit, let&#8217;s hope it&#8217;s something else that comes just as soon!</p>
