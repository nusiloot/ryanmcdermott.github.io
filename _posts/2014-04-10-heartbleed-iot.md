Every so often there are events that change public opinion about a facet of our lives. Whether its recalls on the red dye in our food, revelations about carcinogens in our environment, or disastrous warnings of climate change, we are occasionally pummeled by life-changing news. I think [Heartbleed][1]  is one of these news events where public opinion might change permanently.

This comes on the heels of the Snowden revelations of the past year, and is a rather nasty culmination of security news for the tech world. At a time when our world is becoming connected in fundamentally transformative ways for the human race, we are being impeded by purely cynical corruption from our government on the one hand and bad security software on the other.

The future of our current web and the future of our web of tomorrow depend squarely on us having faith in the systems we have created. The Internet has brought more prosperity in terms of actual wealth and knowledge than any single invention in the span of human history &#8212; more so than even our writing systems and printing presses.

We have connected all of our computers, and digitized so much of the world’s information. All of that is accessible now by devices in our own pockets. A child in the poorest country in the world with a computer and an internet connection has as much access to knowledge as the richest person in the world did just 40 years ago. That is progress.

IoT is the next big leap in progress humanity will make. By connecting all of the world’s devices we will bring phenomenal potential for instantaneous knowledge of our environment, incredibly improved data about our world, and the power to have machines make so many of the mundane decisions about our lives. The only thing that should stand in our way are resources, not our distrust of the very devices that will improve our lives so immensely. As bad as these security revelations are, we shouldn’t despair. Progress will be made. Let us be optimistic, and let us move forward, even if our heart bleeds along the way.
