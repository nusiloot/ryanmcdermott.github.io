I&#8217;ve set out to create a basic Raspberry on Rails app on to login remotely and control a few things remotely in my house. All this via a web interface! You might say, &#8220;Well you could just open an SSH server instead.&#8221; That&#8217;s true, but you could also use a burner Nokia phone instead of your iPhone. Why use an iPhone then? Well, because it&#8217;s cooler &#8212; not to mention you can do a hell of a lot more.

Anyway, all of this is definitely along the IOT lines &#8212; in other words, the future!

In order to get Rails going I thought it would be only fitting to get a more modern version of Ruby, rather than what&#8217;s already installed with Raspbian. Ruby 1.9 is Rube 1.9 &#8212; there&#8217;s so many significant speed improvements to the newer versions of Ruby, and that&#8217;s quite necessary on a relatively slow processing microcomputer like the Pi.

I first set out to get RVM running, which is definitely a must. Ruby without RVM is like not having a drawer for all your socks. In order to get RVM going I ran this:  
`\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`

Once I installed that I ran the following command:

`rvm install 2.1.0`

I figured 2.1.0 would be the best going forward for the next year or two, which is what I&#8217;m willing to commit to prototyping something cool with this type of interface. I let it begin the installation process, took a shower, played some guitar, ate some queso, called my grandma, watched an hour of Jim Gaffigan, took a nap, played some piano, thought about taking another shower, then looked at the installation process. Holy hell, it wasn&#8217;t even close to being done. I ran *top *to see what was going on:

I was slightly relieved that at least cc was running and there was some compilation actually going. I decided to go to bed and wait until the next morning. Fortunately, when I woke up around 7:45 I saw that it had finally finished. It&#8217;s surprising because I thought SSD space would be my biggest concern but it looks like with these little single-threaded processes on one core it&#8217;s actually the CPU power that I&#8217;m more concerned about. Having said that, it&#8217;s an incredible feat of human achievement that we can compile and run all of this software on something the size of a baseball card. The Raspberry Pi and food truck tacos are what should make anyone believe in a higher power &#8212; even if it&#8217;s just the ghost of Dennis Ritchie!

This should be exciting. Now all that&#8217;s left to do is run *gem install rails. *That and write the damn app!
