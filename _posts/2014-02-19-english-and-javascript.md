Being a programmer, I find myself spending way more time learning machine languages than natural languages. I took Spanish for many years but getting consistent practice is incredibly hard, especially since most people can only stand to hear &#8220;[como se dice][1]?&#8221; so many times. Being in America I am inundated with English. But it&#8217;s not just my daily world that reinforces the language, it&#8217;s also the programming world that does it too. Think about how anglicized every major programming language is. Data types, function declarations, libraries, documentation and Stack Overflow posts are all written in, you guessed it, English. This is [bad][2] for two reasons &#8212; the first one is that it is inherently exclusionary to foreign speakers around the world. There are [some programming languages][3] that try to counteract this trend but I have never seen one listed in a resume. The dominant languages are English-based.  The second reason this is bad is simple: English is ensured to be the de facto pidgin language for everyone for the foreseeable future.

English is a bad language. You don&#8217;t have to be a language lover or a programming aficionado to see this. We encounter it every day, especially when your damn spellcheck fails. There&#8217;s a hilarious book about the absurdities of the language: *[Crazy English][4]. *My favorite quote appears in the advertising headline: &#8220;why do people drive on a parkway and park in a driveway, and your nose can run and your feet can smell?&#8221;

English is a hodgepodge because of its myriad influences. Whether it was the Norman conquest, a dash of Greco-Roman tongue, or the Saxons&#8217; proto-German, English became like that strange looking gelatinous smorgasbord your cafeteria lunch lady tried to serve you in elementary school. If you lined up all the natural languages in the world and were to[ erase everyone&#8217;s brains ][5] nobody would pick English to be the language they would want to learn. It&#8217;s simply to strange, too illogical, and too difficult. This isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing. Ultimately whether English ended up good or bad is a null issue &#8212; it developed naturally as do all spoken and written human languages, save for [Esperanto][6]. Like an economy or free jazz, languages aren&#8217;t designed by committees. They emerge out of necessities and conventions. Sure, there&#8217;s some [universal grammar][7] and genetics at work that gives natural languages some commonalities and reasons for existence, but in spite of that they are relatively chaotic in how they form.

Programming languages seem to be the one area where mankind has used his/her greatest intellectual and social abilities to sit down and create a systematic instructional language to create tools and solutions to the problems we encounter. Sure some languages have a *dictator* like Guido Van Rossum (BDFL) of Python, but even that language and most others have tons of input and careful design from a body of contributors. This is contrary to natural languages, which are so capricious and full of inconsistencies that simply using a programming language to understand one perfectly is downright impossible, at least currently. Natural languages live by force and tradition.

Programming languages don&#8217;t live by force or tradition though. Sure we&#8217;re stuck with some shitty Perl scripts and some horrible PHP legacy code for the next long while, but new systems aren&#8217;t stuck to bad languages like these. You can always choose the best tool/language for the job (barring corporate bureaucracy). And if today&#8217;s languages don&#8217;t suffice, newer ones are always going to be developed. I am optimistic that our abstractions will get better and our languages will be richer and more expressive than ever in the near future. This is a rule!

However there&#8217;s one exception: Javascript. This is a language that I will go on record for saying will not go away in the next 20 years. In fact, it will only get stronger and more prevalent. Why? Javascript is the web. It is the *crazy* glue, and I emphasize the word crazy. Sure HTML and CSS keep everything rendering but JS serves as this middle-man between the views and the business logic on the server.

The web does to Javascript what our culture does to English &#8212; it forces a certain way of expression.  Changing the web&#8217;s standards would be about as impossible as changing the culture (American) that enforces English. That is a bit overreaching though, I&#8217;ll admit &#8212; the web standards have a sort of committee that runs them and input from big tech companies. American culture and the English language certainly don&#8217;t have that, even if you factor in the lexicographers and crazy media pundits.

Javascript&#8217;s inability to be substituted out may not necessarily be a problem, depending on your tastes. Javascript has improved a lot in recent years, especially with fast interpreters like Google&#8217;s V8. And if you had to compare apples and oranges I would say Javascript is most definitely better than English. We certainly could have gotten burdened with a much worse language to create our web apps with, and Microsoft certainly tried to make sure [ECMAScript/LiveScript/JS would be that crappy language.][8]

All of this to say though, the unfortunate thing with the web and with Javascript is that we can&#8217;t ask the one question we always hope to ask whenever we start programming a piece of software: Is what I am using the right tool for the job? Javascript is the tool, the only tool, and you&#8217;re not going to get around that. I know that web standards will continue to improve as they always have and our JS engines will get faster, but like there are days when I ask: &#8220;couldn&#8217;t we do better?&#8221;
