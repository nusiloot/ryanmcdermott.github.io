As I delve deeper into the world of the Internet of Things and the Raspberry Pi, I often wonder if Twitter will become a sort of default protocol that our devices use to communicate with us. People have already [written][1] about the potential for Twitter to have an [effect][2] on the IoT world. I think this is nothing short of a spot on prognostication. I wouldn&#8217;t simply stop there though. I think Twitter, in and of itself, is a kind of protocol &#8212; a mass messaging protocol that isn&#8217;t simply wedded to only human users. I think machines following machines and retweeting them is most definitely the way of the future. It sounds humorous now, but I can&#8217;t see why traffic lights across a city wouldn&#8217;t follow each other and relay data back and forth. These are public utilities after all, it would be cool for the public to see their data communication in real time!

I don&#8217;t mean to give into the comical image of your refrigerator tweeting your self-driving car that it&#8217;s out of food and having it drive you over to the grocery store automatically. I do mean though that meaningful sensory data will be communicated by sensor devices to actuators via tweets. These can be simple temperature sensors that tweet out a command to turn off the .

Granted all of that, there&#8217;s plenty of reason to keep tweets private &#8212; you don&#8217;t want your front door tweeting you that your box of laxatives just arrived.  I think as Twitter grows it will be a place to not just see the latest news, messages from friends, and the like. It will also be a place for your devices to respond and react to their environments. It will be that place where you watch all of this happen. Certainly the privacy settings of Twitter are their to make some of this happen already, but I think as it grows and this kind of protocol becomes dominant on IoT devices, privacy settings will be enhanced. That is of course if privacy still exists in ten years or even exists today!

Regardless of that, I think the 140-character messaging protocol that is Twitter will be a standard for the devices of the IoT future. I&#8217;m confident about that, and tweet me if you feel otherwise! [@ryansworks][3]
